# DevOps Project — User API

## Overview

This project is a simple **RESTful User API** that allows:
- Adding users
- Modifying user information
- Deleting users

User data (email and password) is stored in a **MariaDB database**.

The project covers the full **DevOps lifecycle**, including:
- Application development
- Infrastructure as Code **(IaC)**
- Docker containerization
- Continuous Integration **(CI)**
- Container orchestration using **Kubernetes**

---

## 1. Work Performed

### Application :
- Development of a **User API** (CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete)
- User data persistence using **MariaDB**
- **Unit and functional tests** to validate differentes cases

### CI/CD :
- **GitHub Actions pipeline**
  - Automated tests to protect the integrity of the `main` branch
  - Pipeline triggered on push and pull requests

### IaC :
- **Oj rajoute ce que tu as fait !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**




### Containerization

- Creation of a **Docker image** for the User API using a Dockerfile
- The image can be used to run the application locally in a consistent environment
- The image is published to **Docker Hub** for easy distribution

### Kubernetes :
- Local cluster setup using Minikube for container orchestration
- Persistent storage with PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for MariaDB data persistence
- Deployments for both MariaDB database and FastAPI application using Docker images
- Services configured: ClusterIP for internal database access and NodePort for external API access
- Deployment execution using kubectl apply -f k8s/ with all manifest files in the k8s/ director

## 📋 Kubernetes Deployment Verification

### Pod Status
This screenshot shows both MariaDB and FastAPI containers running successfully in the Kubernetes cluster.

![Kubernetes Pods Status](./screenshots/Pod-Status.png)

*All pods show "Running" status with 1/1 readiness, confirming healthy deployments. Both the database and application containers are operational.*

---

### Service Configuration  
This screenshot demonstrates the network services configuration for internal and external communication.

![Kubernetes Services](./screenshots/Service-Configuration.png)

*FastAPI is exposed via NodePort (port 30527) for external access, while MariaDB is secured internally with ClusterIP - following Kubernetes security best practices.*

---

### Application Access URL
This screenshot shows the external access point generated by Minikube for the FastAPI application.

![Minikube Access URL](./screenshots/Application-Access-URL.png)

*Using Minikube's Docker driver on Windows creates a local tunnel at 127.0.0.1:60338, which is the standard behavior for local Kubernetes development on Windows.*

---

### API Response Verification
This screenshot confirms the FastAPI application is responding successfully to HTTP requests.

![API Response Test](./screenshots/API-Response-Verification.png)

*Successful 200 OK response with HTML content, proving the web interface is fully functional and accessible through the Kubernetes service.*

---

### Persistent Storage Status
This screenshot shows the persistent storage configuration ensuring database data persistence.

![Persistent Storage](./screenshots/Persistent-Storage-Status.png)

*Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) are "Bound", ensuring MariaDB data persists across pod restarts and container recreations.*

---

## ✅ Deployment Summary
All five verification steps confirm a successful Kubernetes deployment: containers are running, networking is configured, persistent storage is active, and the application is fully accessible.


## 3. Useful Commands

### Run the application locally (development)

```bash
python .\devopsproject\app.py
```

### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t devopsapp .
```

---

### Run the application using Docker

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e DEVOPS_DB_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  devopsapp
```

### Authenticate to Docker Hub

```bash
docker login
```

---

### Tag the Docker image for Docker Hub

```bash
docker tag devopsapp hmorais1001/devopsapp:latest
```

---

### Push the Docker image to Docker Hub

```bash
docker push hmorais1001/devopsapp:latest
```

---

## 6. 

- AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini) were used to improve the clarity and structure of documentation and to facilitate certain tasks. No application code or infrastructure configuration was fully generated or directly used.


## Bonus 

- The application was developed in Python instead of the NodeJS application provided in the labs.
- Additional API features, validation logic, and unit/functional tests were implemented compared to the base example.
